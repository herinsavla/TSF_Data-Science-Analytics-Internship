The Sparks Foundation is a non-profit organization running in India and Singapore.They inspire students to innovate and help them integrate to build a better humankind. Being a virtual intern hired via their GRIP program, I've created this repository to showcase my work and learnings through various assigned tasks.


### Task 2: To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task, I predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours he/she studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Furthermore, I predicted the score of a student who studied for 9.25 hrs in a day.

### Task 3: To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning 
From the classic Iris dataset, I predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

### Task 4: To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm
For the Iris dataset, I create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose of this task is to make the classifier predict the right class upon feeding new data.

### Task 5: To explore Business Analytics
I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided Superstore dataset. Here, I'm working for the business owner of the retail firm who wants to find out all the weak areas where performance is poor and more profit can be made. I had to derive as many business problems as I can by looking into exploring and analyzing this data.
